This is my text to speech converter, you can select pdf, docx or txt files (or create and save your own thorugh the app), it uses Amazon's polly Speech Synthesizer API to convert
the files into MP3. The GUI has been made with the Kivy Module. I have created this from scratch using the Amazon polly and Kivy documentation (and plenty of kivy youtube vids!).
